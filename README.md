The user is guided through a menu-based system, which continuously prompts for input until they decide to exit.

💼 Core Concepts Covered
Account Management: Maintains a balance (starting at ₹1000).

User Interaction: The user selects options from a menu.

✨ Learning Takeaway
Demonstrates basic object-oriented programming by organizing the functionality inside a class.

Reinforces the use of methods to separate concerns: showing balance, crediting, and debiting.

Illustrates user input handling using loops and conditionals.
